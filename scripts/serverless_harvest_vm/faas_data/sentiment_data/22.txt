The only thing that sucks more than having a fight with your partner is having your argument spill over to text message. You need to treat the serious texts you send your partner like you're setting a meeting or a dentist appointment. This isn't an idle conversation that can happen when it's convenient. You do need to apply some pressure so your partner knows that you take the conflict — and finding a resolution — seriously. At the same time, you need to be loose enough with your messaging so that neither of you feel like it's a conversation you need to address right away.The reason getting a "we need to talk" text sucks so much is that it immediately sends your imagination spiraling down a one-way street that leads directly to a breakup. Addressing a conflict is important because it allows you both to establish boundaries within a relationship, but you don't want your partner to think that you're going to dump them every time you have a minor disagreement.
