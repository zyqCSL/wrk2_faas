Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that the U.S. willful trespassing is the cause of tensions in the South China Sea, and its attempt to sow discord is the threat to regional peace and stability. 

For quite some time the U.S. has been trying to disrupt peace and stability in the South China Sea by stirring up trouble and creating splits. Countries in the region have been soberly aware of that, said Spokesperson Geng Shuang at a regular press conference. 

With the joint efforts by China and ASEAN countries, situation in the South China Sea is generally stable and there is no problem at all with freedom of navigation, Geng noted. 

In the 22nd China-ASEAN Summit that was recently concluded, parties were pleased with and inspired by the progress made in the negotiations of the Code of Conduct, he added.

"China stands ready to work with ASEAN countries to overcome disturbances and advance the scheduled consultations based on equal-footed consensus. China and ASEAN countries have the confidence, wisdom and capability to make the South China Sea a sea of peace, friendship and cooperation, and uphold the lasting peace and stability in this region," Geng said. 

The U.S. frequently sent military vessels and aircraft to this region for provocation in other countries' territorial waters or joint exercises to flex its military muscle. Geng urged the U.S. to grasp the positive momentum in the region, respect and support regional countries' effort for stability, and stop making unconstructive, irresponsible and unpopular moves that undermine peace and stability in the South China Sea.
