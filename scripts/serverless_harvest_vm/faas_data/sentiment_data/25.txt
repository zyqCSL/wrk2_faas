Sounds like you sent some .. Did it help a bit? You got a bit off your chest? If you want to stop texting you can draft a text with everything in it you would not dare say, and save it in drafts. Dont send it. It can greatly help! A long detailed draft. Then you can separately request the person get back to you if you want explanation from them. But it might not be what you want. If you do not, just engage to whatever level you need to. Let yourself send as many texts as you like. It will stop when it does nothing more for you. I could say try and stop. But you already are so whats the use? Just STOP because you have finished with it and you are in charge of your desire the disengage!
