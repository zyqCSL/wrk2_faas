How do I stop sending text to someone I am angry at?

If you know anything about narcissistic personality disorder it is to your benefit to not send a text whatsoever — angry or not. Narcissists, once they devalue you and discard you, will take any response from you as supply. Remain NO CONTACT.

So — in the event that the person that you are angry with … that hurt you … that you want to send an angry text to … that is very possibly a narcissist, it is to YOUR BENEFIT to do nothing. Block them … AND DO NOT RESPOND TO THEM.
